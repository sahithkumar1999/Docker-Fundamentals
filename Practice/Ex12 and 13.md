## E12: Working with MultisequenceExperiment
1.	Add the Neocortexapi NuGet package to your project.
2.	Include the necessary files for the NeoCortexApiSample namespace.
3.	Run the RunMultiSequenceLearningExperiment() method.
4.	Perform the experiment by modifying the learning sequence list to include "S1 and S2."
5.	Show active columns with the python script.


## E13: Working with SpatialPatternLearning
1.	Fork the neocortexapi repository.
2.	Clone the forked repository to local machine.
3.	Execute the SpatialPatternLearning() method.
4.	Adjust the maxSPLearningCycles to 5, 10, 15, and observe the experimentation and analysis of spatial pattern learning over multiple cycles
5.	Show active columns with the python script.
